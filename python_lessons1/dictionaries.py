# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

info = {
  "Name": "Junaid",
  "Age": 36,
  "Gender": "Male"
}
print(info)

# Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
# Print the "Name" value of the dictionary:

print(info["Name"]) # It will return Junaid
